        <h2>One Piece</h2>
        <p>
          Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most
          infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and
          execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout
          the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of
          the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation
          that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of
          finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and
          fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the
          Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your
          standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a
          wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun,
          Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought
          of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and
          ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his
          childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line,
          experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling
          strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all
          fortunes—One Piece. [Written by MAL Rewrite]
